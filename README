  - Support for C++ style single line and block comments
  - break does not have to be the last statement in a block
  - More strict handling of invalid escape sequences in a string
  - Includes bit library

  API:
  - Added lua_setgchook function
  - IO library can be registered with callbacks for custom file system access
  
Building
